# ‚öõÔ∏è Cycloton Algorithm
An nlgorith project to practice data sctructure and algorithm efficiency.

## üíª About this project
The algorithm in this project has a function called `cyclotron` that circulate a particle inside a cyclotron. The cycles for each particle type is unique. The first parameter of cyclotron function is the matrix value, and the second one is the particle type. The minimum matrix value is 4, and the particle types the function can receive are:

- electron (e);
- proton (p);
- neutron (n).

Cyclotron without particles (`cyclotron(4)`) output:
```
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1]
```
Cyclotron accelerating an electron (`cyclotron(4, 'e')`) output:
```
[e, e, e, e]
[1, 1, 1, e]
[1, 1, 1, e]
[1, 1, 1, e]
```
Cyclotron accelerating a neutron (`cyclotron(4, 'n')`) output:
```
[n, n, n, n]
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[1, 1, 1, 1]
```

## üéØ Used skills
- Good practices in data structure, functions, and algorithm efficiency

## üèÅ Getting started
### üêç Installing Python 3
You will need Python 3 in order to run the application. You can see how to install it [here](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download).
Once Python 3 is installed, you can follow the next steps to create a virtual enviroment and install the dependencies in it.

### üå± Creating virtual enviroment and installing dependencies
To create the virtual enviroment, run:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
To activate the virtual enviroment in a shell enviroment, run:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
To deactivate the virtual enviroment, you can simply run the command `deactivate`.

To install the dependencies in virtual enviroment, run:
```
python3 -m pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

## üß™ Testing
To execute all tests, in virtual enviroment run:
```
python3 -m pytest
```
If some issue occurs, you can alternatively run `python3 -m pytest -s -vv`.

To execute one specifict test file, you can run the command with the file path. Example:
```
python3 -m pytest tests/file_path/file_name.py
```
To execute one specific test function, you can run the command with the flag `-k` and the function. Example:
```
python3 -m pytest -k function_name
```
